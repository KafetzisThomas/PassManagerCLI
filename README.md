2. I am a total amateur at programming so if something doesn't work I'll try to fix it but might not even know how, so don't expect too much. __I OFFER NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE FOR THIS SCRIPT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.__ I tested it on my own and implemented some failsafes as best as I could, but there could always be some kind of bug. You should inspect the code yourself.
